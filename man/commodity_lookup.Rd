\usage{
commodity_lookup(value, lookuptable)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{Commodity name or commodity code, as a char or numeric vector.}

\item{lookuptable}{Dataframe of commodity descriptions and codes (intended 
input is the dataframe created by function 
\code{\link{ct_commodities_table}}).}
}
\value{
A character vector of commodity descriptions that are matches with 
 the input.
}
\description{
The Comtrade API requires that searches for specific commodities be done 
using commodity codes. This is a helper function for querying the 
commodity code lookup table that's created by function 
\code{\link{ct_commodities_table}}. It takes as input a commodity or 
commodity code as a vector. If input is a commodity, then output is all 
commodity codes and descriptions that are associated with the input value. 
If input is a commodity code, then output is the commodity description 
associated with that input code. For use with the UN Comtrade API, full API 
docs can be found at \url{https://comtrade.un.org/data/doc/api/}
