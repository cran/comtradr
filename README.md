<!-- badges: end --> Interface with and extract data from the United
Nations Comtrade API <https://comtradeplus.un.org/>. Comtrade provides
country level shipping data for a variety of commodities, these
functions allow for easy API query and data returned as a tidy data
frame. More info can be found
[here](https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/comtrade). Full API
documentation can be found [here](https://comtradedeveloper.un.org/).

The Comtrade API has been undergoing updates in 2023. At this point the
legacy API has been taken offline (see
[here](https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/comtrade/New+Comtrade+FAQ+for+Advanced+Users#NewComtradeFAQforAdvancedUsers-WhatisthelegacyoftheUNComtrade?UntilwhencanIuseit?)).
The `comtradr` package has accommodated these changes. Some premium
functions like bulk download are still not supported in the package, but
we are working on it. See
<https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues/68> for details.

Please [report](https://github.com/ropensci/comtradr/issues) issues,
comments, or feature requests. We are very much looking for feedback on
the usability of the new functions.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Currently, the package is not on CRAN, but we plan on publishing to CRAN
in the near future. Install the current development version from this
repo:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/comtradr@main")
```

Once it is on CRAN, you can install with:

``` r
install.packages("comtradr")
```

## Usage

### Authentication üîê

**Do not be discouraged by the complicated access to the token - you can
do it! üí™**

As stated above, you need an API token, see the FAQ of Comtrade for
details on how to obtain it:

‚û°Ô∏è
<https://unstats.un.org/wiki/display/comtrade/New+Comtrade+User+Guide#NewComtradeUserGuide-UNComtradeAPIManagement>

You need to follow the detailed explanations, which include screenshots,
in the Wiki of Comtrade to the letter. ‚òùÔ∏è I am not writing them out
here, because they might be updated regularly. However, once you are
signed up, select the `comtrade - v1` product, which is the free API.

#### Storing the API key

If you are in an interactive session, you can call the following
function to save your API token to the environment file for the current
session.

``` r
library(comtradr)

set_primary_comtrade_key()
```

If you are not in an interactive session, you can register the token
once in your session using the following base-r function.

``` r
Sys.setenv('COMTRADE_PRIMARY' = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')
```

If you would like to set the comtrade key permanently, we recommend
editing the project `.Renviron` file, where you need to add a line with
`COMTRADE_PRIMARY = xxxx-your-key-xxxx`.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Do not forget the line break after the last entry. This is the
easiest by taking advantage of the great `usethis` package.

``` r
usethis::edit_r_environ(scope = 'project')
```

### Example 1 ‚õ¥Ô∏è

Now we can get to actually request some data. Let us query the total
trade between China and Germany and Argentina, as reported by China.

``` r

# Country names passed to the API query function must be spelled in ISO3 format. 
# For details see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3 

# You can request a maximum interval of twelve years from the API
example1 <- comtradr::ct_get_data(
  reporter = 'CHN',
  partner = c('ARG', 'DEU'),
  start_date = 2010,
  end_date = 2012
)

# Inspect the return data
str(example1)
```

### Example 2 ‚õ¥Ô∏è

Return all exports related to Wine from Argentina to all other
countries, for years 2007 through 2011.

``` r
library(comtradr)

# Fetch all shrimp related commodity codes from the Comtrade commodities DB.
# This vector of codes will get passed to the API query.
wine_codes <- ct_commodity_lookup("wine", return_code = TRUE, return_char = TRUE)

# API query.
example2 <- ct_get_data(
  reporter =  "ARG",
  flow_direction = "export",
  partner = "all",
  start_date = 2007,
  end_date = 2011,
  commodity_code = wine_codes
)

# Inspect the output
str(example2)
```
